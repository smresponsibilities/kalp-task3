# ðŸš€ Building a Frontend for Kalp Blockchain Smart Contract Interaction

## Challenge Overview

This challenge focuses on developing a frontend application that interacts with a smart contract deployed on the Kalp blockchain. You'll use React and TypeScript to create a user interface that communicates with your smart contract via API endpoints generated by Kalp Studio.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this challenge, you will:

- Gain practical experience with React and TypeScript.
- Learn to interact with blockchain smart contracts from a frontend.
- Understand API integration in decentralized applications (dApps).
- Master state management and asynchronous operations in React.
- Enhance your skills in building user interfaces for blockchain applications.

## Understanding Frontend-Blockchain Interaction

This challenge simulates real-world scenarios where dApps require a user-friendly interface to interact with blockchain smart contracts. You'll create a bridge between user actions and blockchain operations.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version >=14.x) and npm (version >=6.x)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Build-Hackathon/junior.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd junior/frontend
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Frontend Structure

The main component of the frontend is the `useKalpApi.ts` hook, which encapsulates API calls to the smart contract. It includes functions for:

1. Claiming tokens
2. Checking account balance
3. Retrieving total token supply

## Configuring the Frontend

1. Deploy your smart contract on Kalp Studio and generate API endpoints.
2. Create an API key in Kalp Studio for authentication.
3. Set up environment variables in your frontend project.
4. Update API endpoints in `useKalpApi.ts` with the generated endpoints.

## Running the Frontend Application

1. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. Use the interface to interact with your smart contract functions.

## Key Components

- `useKalpApi` hook: Manages API calls, loading states, and error handling.
- API integration: Utilizes fetch for making HTTP requests to the Kalp blockchain API.
- Environment variable management: Securely stores and uses the API key.

## Conclusion

This challenge provides hands-on experience in connecting a frontend application to a blockchain smart contract. It covers essential aspects of dApp development, including API integration, state management, and user interface design for blockchain interactions.
